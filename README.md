# hyper-rogue
Roguelike game using Hypermedia Driven Application architecture (from the book https://hypermedia.systems/).

Taking inspiration from Carson Gross to build simpler frontend/backend (creator of https://grugbrain.dev/, https://missing.style/, https://hypermedia.systems/, https://htmx.org/)


# Technologies
- GO API
- Frontend: htmx, missing.css
- Turn based, frontend only updates on  listens to events from backend using Server-Sent Events

# Game mechanics
Overbold from UFO50 but with turn based roguelike movement. Enemy movement from Crypt of the Necrodancer.
